        <p>Job security is a constant concern for a large amount of Americans—nearly 55% of full-time workers have become increasingly concerned with the possibility of losing their jobs, a recent survey found <a class="ref" href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. While there are a multitude of reasons why one might not feel secure with their careers, A.I is seemingly at the forefront of these concerns, with automation in the form of A.I. becoming vastly more prevalent within different career paths as its technology evolves. In this article, this concern and its validity will be addressed, as we will discuss the ramifications of A.I. within various career paths, as well as those that will benefit from it instead.</p>

        <header>Defining A.I. and Automation</header>
        <p>Automation is defined as "the use of scientific and technological principles and control systems to control the manufacture of machines and the development of processes that take over work normally performed by humans" <a class="ref" href="#ref_2">[2]</a>. On the other hand, A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, is defined as "a subfield of computer science that is concerned with the representation, study, and <em>automation</em> of knowledge and intelligent reasoning" <a class="ref" href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.  Evidently, A.I. is essentially intertwined with automation by definition and it can be inferred that a large part of automation's growth is dependent on the evolution and constant development of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

        <header>A Brief History of Automation</header>  
        <p>In order to truly understand the relationship between automation and artificial intelligence, as well as the concerns that automation raises in terms of job displacement, one must consider the historical extent of automation. In doing so, we find that these concerns are nothing new or out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>While there is some dispute on the first exact instance of automation, its onset is generally regarded as aligning with the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century. Around this time, many steam-powered machines were developed in order to assist in tasks rather than entirely replace the work done by a human. An prominent example of such is French inventor Basile Bouchon’s semi-automated drawloom, which upon its creation in 1725, allowed for the user to simply continuously step on a pedal in order to weave a preset pattern into a piece of cloth. While this massively accelerated the process of clothing-making, the machine still required a human operator, and it wasn’t until 1804 that Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented a fully-automated loom–nearly a century later <a class="ref" href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.</p>
        <p>Historically, automation has always appeared as a “double-edged sword”—an array of innovations that can help industries deliver great results when it comes to productivity, but at the very same time strikes fear of displacement in the workers that belong to these industries. In reality, however, many of these industries’ workforce may initially feel disconcerted, but these same innovations often present new skills and positions necessary to complement them. Author David E. Newton says that “[w]hile increased automation does lead to worker displacement in multiple industries, the loss is largely offset by the creation of new industries and jobs.” <a class="ref" href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.</p>
        <p>So with that being said, is history bound to repeat itself? It’s easy to assume that these past evolutions of automation (such as the auto-loom) would suggest that artificial intelligence will only make jobs easier at first, and replace the need for human effort later on. This seems likely to be the case for some career positions, but not all, however.</p>

        <header>Career Impact of A.I. Automation</header>
        <p>Artificial intelligence’s constant development raises a complex and convoluted issue in terms of the careers it may affect. Author Xu Huang finds that “existing literature generally suggests that A.I. will replace low-skilled labor while complementing high-skilled labor” while at the same time “A.I. systems like ChatGPT are gradually replacing high-skilled labor, such as accountants and lawyers” [4]. From these statements alone, it’s apparent that artificial intelligence poses an unprecedented scenario for many people in the working class, and with it their concerns become further amplified.</p>
        <p>In the same writing however, Huang also states that “in the long term, A.I.’s overall impact on labor employment is relatively modest […] in the short term, A.I. will lead to a dramatic transformation of the labor market” [4]. Interestingly enough, this idea echoes what was previously indicated about automation as a whole; it’s evident that A.I. automation, for the most part and unsurprisingly, will likely follow a similar pattern as previous forms of automation, only possibly on a larger scale.</p>
        <p>But understandably, a majority of the concern with A.I. automation weighs largely on the unknown of the near future, not the distant. We may not all even be alive by the time A.I. has become seamlessly integrated into our careers, after all. So who should be concerned the most and who has little to worry about?</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="suffer_vs_benefit">
        <header>Which careers will suffer the most? Which will benefit?</header>
        <p>As previously mentioned, low-skilled labor (also known as unskilled labor) would appear to be the most at risk of full-on replacement by A.I. automation. These careers are generally considered as requiring minimal education and/or training. While not all equally at-risk, some of these careers are repetitive and/or time-consuming, and in turn are the most easily automatable, including (but not limited to) [5]:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Factory Workers</li>
          <li>Cashiers</li>
          <li>Bank Tellers</li>
          <li>Drivers</li>
          <li>Telemarketers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meanwhile, high-skilled labor is generally more secure from A.I. replacement, but is not necessarily absolved from being altered by artificial intelligence either. The human-impact on these careers are generally considered to be harder to replicate due to the fact that “[c]reativity and critical thinking are things people can do better” than A.I. [5]. Regardless, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Labor & Economic Analysis Division (LEAD) [6] finds that in terms of white-collar workers, the top careers that are most likely to be exposed to A.I. are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Legal</li>
          <li>Business and financial operations</li>
          <li>Computer and mathematical</li>
          <li>Educational instruction and library</li>
          <li>Management</li>
        </ul>
