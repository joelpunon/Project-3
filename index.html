        <p>Job security is a constant concern for a large amount of Americans--nearly 55% of full-time workers have become increasingly concerned with the possibility of losing their jobs, a recent survey found <a class="ref" href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. While there are a multitude of reasons why one might not feel secure with their careers, A.I is seemingly at the forefront of these concerns, with automation in the form of A.I. becoming vastly more prevalent within different career paths as its technology evolves. In this article, this concern and its validity will be addressed, as we will discuss the ramifications of A.I. within various career paths, as well as those that will benefit from it instead.</p>

        <p>Automation is defined as "the use of scientific and technological principles and control systems to control the manufacture of machines and the development of processes that take over work normally performed by humans" <a class="ref" href="#ref_2">[2]</a>. On the other hand, A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, is defined as "a subfield of computer science that is concerned with the representation, study, and <em>automation</em> of knowledge and intelligent reasoning" <a class="ref" href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.  Evidently, A.I. is essentially intertwined with automation by definition and it can be inferred that a large part of automation's growth is dependent on the evolution and constant development of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

        <header>The History of Automation</header>  
        <p>In order to truly understand the relationship between automation and artificial intelligence, as well as the concerns that automation raises in terms of job displacement, one must consider the historical extent of automation. In doing so, we find that these concerns are nothing new or out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>While there is some dispute on the first exact instance of automation, its onset is generally regarded as aligning with the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century. Around this time, many steam-powered machines were developed in order to assist in tasks rather than entirely replace the work done by a human. An prominent example of such is French inventor Basile Bouchon’s semi-automated drawloom, which upon its creation in 1725, allowed for the user to simply continuously step on a pedal in order to weave a preset pattern into a piece of cloth. While this massively accelerated the process of clothing-making, the machine still required a human operator, and it wasn’t until 1805 that Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented a fully-automated loom–nearly a century later [2].</p> 
        <p>So with that being said, is history bound to repeat itself? It’s easy to assume that these past evolutions of automation (such as the auto-loom) would suggest that artificial intelligence will only make jobs easier at first, and replace the need for human effort later on. This, however, seems likely to be the case for some career positions, but not all.</p>
